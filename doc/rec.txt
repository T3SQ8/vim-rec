The set of commands below will be available whenever you edit a .rec file.

COMMANDS                                    *recutils-commands*

These commands operate on buffers so you don't have to pass them a filepath as an
argument (unless you want to run the command on a different file).

                            the output in a |location-list| in the current window.

:Recinf {args}              Run recinf with the supplied arguments and display the
                            output in a |location-list| in the current window.
